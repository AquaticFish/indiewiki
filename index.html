  <h1>Independent Music</h1>
    <p> Independent music <em>(also commonly known as
    indie music, or simply indie)</em> is music produced
    independently from commercial record labels or
    their subsidiaries; this may include an 
    autonomous, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">do-it-yourself</a>
    approach to recording
    and publishing. As a genre term, <em>"indie"</em> may or may
    not comprise independently produced 
    music.</p>

<p> Many independent music artists do not fall
  into a single defined musical style or genre,
  with their self-published music being able to 
  be categorized into diverse genres without the
  expectations associated with commercial music. The term <em>'indie'</em>
   or <em>'independent music'</em> can be 
  traced back to as early as the 1920s: in the 
  context of referencing independent film companies.
  It was later used to classify an independent band
  or record producer. </p>

  <p> Independent labels have a long history of promoting developments 
    in popular music, stretching back to the post-war period in the 
    United States, with labels such as 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records">Sun Records, </a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Records_(United_States)">King Records </a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stax_Records">Stax. </a>

    
    </p>

    <p>In the United Kingdom during the 1950s and 1960s, the major record companies had 
      so much power that independent labels struggled to become established, until the 
      launch of new concepts like 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records">Virgin Records</a>
      .Several British producers and artists 
      launched independent labels as outlets for their work and artists they liked; 
      the majority failed as commercial ventures or were bought by the major labels.</p>

      <p>In the United States, independent labels and distributors often banded together 
        to form organizations to promote trade and parity within the industry. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recording_Academy">The Recording Academy</a>
        ,famous as the organization behind the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards">Grammy Awards</a>, 
        began in the 1950s as an organization of 25 independent record labels including 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Records">Herald,</a> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_Records_(US_label)"> Ember,</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records ">Atlantic Records.</a>
        The 1970s saw the founding of the 
        <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Independent_Music"> 
        National Association of Independent Record Distributors</a>
        <em>(NAIRD)</em>, which became 
        <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Independent_Music">A2IM </a>
        in 2004. Smaller organizations also existed including the Independent Music Association 
        <em>(IMA)</em>, founded by Don Kulak in the late 1980s. At its zenith, 
        it had 1,000 independent labels on its member rosters. The 1990s
        brought Affiliated Independent Record Companies <em>(AIRCO)</em>, whose most notable member was
        upstart 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock"> punk</a>
        -thrash rock label 
        <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_Records"> Mystic Records</a>, 
        and The Independent Music Retailer's Association <em>(IMRA)</em>, 
        a short-lived organization founded by Mark Wilkins and Don Kulak.
         The latter is most notable for a lawsuit involving co-op money it filed on behalf of 
        its member Digital Distributors in conjunction with Warehouse Record Stores.[5] T
        he adjudication of the case grossed $178,000,000 from the distribution arms of major 
        labels. The proceeds were distributed amongst all plaintiffs.</p>
